<h1 align="center"> About </h1>

<p>
As a lover of nerd culture, I have always felt the need for a way to monitor the works that I follow on certain sites. With this idea in mind, I ended up creating a "tracker" to keep track of the history and state of each series.

This was my first experience building an extension for a browser, so I had a great opportunity to learn about how the storage tool works and the application lifecycle. Despite having a different name, the essence is the same as any web project, html, css, js which made it a lot easier due to my previous experiences.
